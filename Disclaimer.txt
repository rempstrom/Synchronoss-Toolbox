DISCLAIMER
==========================

The Synchronoss Toolbox was made by a fellow criminal investigator who was determined to sift through the disorganized data provided by Synchronoss. It was made through mostly trial and error and with a lot of help from AI coding agents to create python scripts. It is not a polished tool made by professional coders. 

Synchronoss Toolbox was created as a "one time use" tool for one specific case, but it's now being shared since the format could likely be similar for your Synchronoss returns. 

If it doesn't work for your data... sorry about that. 

GOOD LUCK!
