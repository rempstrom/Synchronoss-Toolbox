User Guide - Synchronoss Parser
===============================

This Synchronoss Toolbox is a project developed to assist with converting Verizon/Synchronoss backups into more useful formats so that they are easier to analyze by investigators. This tool was developed for one time use specific to a search warrant return that I recieved in 2025. Rather than keep it for myself I decided to share it. 

Here is the recommended work flow: 


Decrypt & Unzip
===============================

The Decrypt/Upzip will decrypt GPG encrypted files and unzip any .zip archives. This function assumes you have downloaded all available files from the "leotransfers.com" page provided by Synchronoss, and that you have the password to decrypt the files. 

Encrypted Archive: [path/to/your/selection.zip]
Output Folder: [path/to/your/output/folder]
Password: [Decryption Password Provided by Synchronoss]

Once you have input these fields, click "Run" and it will automatically decrypt the GPG encrypted files, and also unzip any .zip archives.


Collect Quarantine Files
===============================

The Collect Quarantine Files will collected the quarantined media files and place them into a folder of your choice. This function assumes you now have an unencryped and unzipped "quarantine" folder containing several files with a .zip_file_* extension. The tool will read the file headers and determine what type of file it is, then add the proper extension.

Note: This function should be able to manage long file path names without errors.  


Root Folder: [path/to/your/quarantine folder]
Output Folder: [path/to/your/output/folder]

Once you have input these fields, click "Run". You should end up with all of the quarantined media neatly in a single folder. 


Contacts to Excel
===============================

The Contacts to Excel function is designed to receive your -contacts.txt file and reformat it into a more human readable excel spreadsheet. 

'Contacts.txt' File Path: [path/to/your/-contacts.txt]
Output File: [Path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx]

Once you have input these fields, click "Convert". You should end up with a single Excel spreadsheet. 


Collect Media
===============================

The Collect Media function assumes you have bulk media stored within numerous different folders. The tool assumes you have a "VZMOBILE" folder. It will go into every folder and extract the files, then place them into a folder of your choice. 

'VZMOBILE' Folder Path: [path/to/your/VZMOBILE folder]
Output Folder: [path/to/your/output/folder]
Contacts File: [path/to/your/contacts_excel.xlsx] - Don't use the .txt file for this

After clicking "Run", you should end up with a folder containing bulk media, and also a subfolder named "Compiled_media_log" which stores an excel spreadsheet log of all of the media files that it found as well as metadata for each file. 


Render Transcripts
===============================

The Render Transcripts function will accept your "messages" folder and then generate HTML format chat threads. They should be displayed in a text message bubble format. The chats automatically pull the appropriate attachments into the chat. The tool will also cross reference the numbers saved in the contacts spreadsheet and fill in the names. The tool will separate out the phone calls into a separate "call log". 

Input Folder: [path/to/your/messages folder]
Output Folder: [path/to/your/output/folder]
Contacts File: [path/to/your/contacts_excel.xlsx] - Don't use the .txt file for this
Target Phone number: [phone number of your target] 

This tool requests the 11 digit format of the target phone number due to the international code "1" being present (eg: 18882024564)

After clicking "Render", you should end up with multiple HTML format files (one per conversation) and a separate "call log" spreadsheet for voice calls. 

Collect Attachments
===============================

The Collect Attachments function essentially does the same thing as the Collect Media function. It assumes you have bulk media stored within an "attachments" folder. It will extract all of the media and place them into a single folder. The files will be renamed to show who sent the attachment, and the associated date. 

Attachments Folder: [path/to/your/attachments folder]
Output Folder: [path/to/your/output/folder]
Contacts file: [path/to/your/contacts_excel.xlsx] - Don't use the .txt file for this

After clicking "Run", you should end up with a single folder containing bulk media and a sub folder named "compiled_attachment_log" which stores an excel spreadsheet of all of the media files found along with metadata for each file.
